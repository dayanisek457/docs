### What is SkyAI?

> SkyAI is an external tool, developed by SkyX International, using Artificial Intelligence. The main goal of SkyAI is to assist every Avgeek in their goals, thanks to its smart courses and aviation regulations training process. Whether you can ask for flight simulation help, PPL-to-ATPL personal guidance, or even generate content through our integrated AI features.

### How to manage SkyAI?

> You have the full control. SkyAI only operates its actions after user request. You can either activate it by clicking "Generate with AI" where applicable on the interface or with the chat mode by clicking on the bot button on the top right corner of the interface.
>
> By default, SkyAI is always disabled and it becomes active once operating any of the actions described above, and gets disabled once the request is done.
>
> The default model of SkyAI uses Gemini (by Google) API. Every user has a free access to it, currently with a 10 requests per day rate if you use the free AI pool feature. We are planning to add more requests in the future.
>
> If you would like to use another LLM model like Claude, ChatGPT or LLaMA via API, you can edit these via the AI configuration panel in the Settings menu.

<Warning>
  If you use your own LLM API settings (BYOK feature), AI providers billing and terms apply. Please check their pricing and select the right model corresponding to the one you want.

  **DISCLAIMER**: some features require some fine and realistic precision to give proper accurate results (e.g. Aircraft Profiles, Lessons). You may want to select a powerful and accurate LLM model. We can NOT guarantee any accurate results regarding to your selected AI model.
</Warning>

### What is a "request"?

Every time you invoke SkyAI through the integrated AI generation features listed below counts as a request, regardless of the complexity of the task. 1 request is automatically billed from your free AI pool usage once you use it.

## Features.

### Integrated AI generation.

> Everywhere a button or mention says "Generate with AI" (or similar), SkyAI's text generation feature is being used. You can use this feature on the following pages:
>
> - Custom Lesson Generator: on the Lessons page, you can generate PPL to ATPL mini-courses, with detailed explanations. Simply prompt on the bar what do you want, and SkyAI will automatically save a detailed lesson to your library. The more you describe with details what output do you want, the more your generated lesson will be personalised and accurate. Each lesson is saved privately on your library.
> - Flashcards and Mock Exams sets: learn actively aviation terms and knowledge with these two different features, available on the Study Mode page. We suggest you to be accurate and precise when typing your request so your result will be more appropriated.
> - Aircraft Profiles: very useful AI feature integrated if you don't know the exact configurations of your aircraft\*.
> - Radio Training sets: if you want to learn aviation radio communications, this feature is very useful to learn realistic scenarios.
> - Checklist Builder: generate in-depth checklists for flight simulation uses. Create the scenario you want and challenge yourself in realistic circumstances\*\!
>
> \*(**WARNING**: we do NOT recommend to use this feature for real-life flights. If you do so, we highly suggest to double-check the results with verified sources.)

### Chatting mode.

> You can activate SkyAI chatting mode by clicking the bot button, located on the top right corner of the interface. You will arrive in a page where multiple LLMs are included and pre-trained. On top left corner, you can select the AI you want to chat with. 5 different selections are ready to use:
>
> 1. SkyAI Advanced Assistant.
>
> The Advanced Assistant is SkyX Internationalâ€™s flagship AI chatbot, built not just to reply, but to think, strategize, and deliver.
>
> 1. Smart Analysis\
>    Instead of instantly answering like most basic bots, the assistant thinks first. It analyzes your request and picks the best route.
> 2. Dynamic & Hybrid Execution\
>    Depending on what you asked, it routes the task to specialized models:
>    - One for real-time web search
>    - One for RAG & Wikipedia lookup
>    - One for data tools or aviation APIs\
>      All happening in the background.
> 3. Hyper Response\
>    It then collects all the insights and crafts a smart, accurate, and context-aware reply, like a full crew of AIs working as one.
>
> Several function-calling tools are currently supported, like Web search, RAG (Knowledge Base), Wikipedia, aviation API requests. We are working on implementing more tools, like image generation, aviation databases.
>
> Chatting with SkyAI Advanced Assistant is free for everyone with 25 interactions (1 interaction = 1 request \+ reply) per month.
>
> 2. Kimi K2 (MoonshotAI).
> 3. DeepSeek R1 (DeepSeek).
> 4. DeepSeek V3 (DeepSeek).
> 5. QwQ 32B (Qwen/Alibaba Cloud).
