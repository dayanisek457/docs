### What is SkyAI?

> SkyAI is an external tool, developed by SkyX International, using Artificial Intelligence. The main goal of SkyAI is to assist every Avgeek in their goals, thanks to its smart courses and aviation regulations training process. Whether you can ask for flight simulation help, PPL-to-ATPL personal guidance, or even generate content through our integrated AI features.

### How to manage SkyAI?

> You have the full control. SkyAI only operates its actions after user request. You can either activate it by clicking "Generate with AI" where applicable on the interface or with the chat mode by clicking on the bot button on the top right corner of the interface.
>
> By default, SkyAI is always disabled and it becomes active once operating any of the actions described above.
>
> The default model of SkyAI uses Gemini (by Google) API. Every user has a free access to it, but the usage is shared and monthly rates may apply if too much sollicited.
>
> If you'd like to use another LLM model like Claude, ChatGPT or LLaMA via API, you can edit these via the AI configuration panel in the Settings menu.

<Warning>
  If you use your own LLM API settings, AI providers billing and terms apply. Please check their pricing and select the right model corresponding to the one you want.
</Warning>

### Data privacy

> SkyAI NEVERS collect any data except for your requests. Each request you send to SkyAI is internally processed by the LLM and SkyX International primarly uses LLM that doesn't train itself on the data you send to SkyAI. 
>
> For more information, please check the SkyReach Academy privacy policy on the settings page.

## Features

### Integrated AI generation

> Everywhere a button or mention says "Generate with AI" (or similar), SkyAI's text generation feature is being used. You can use this feature on the following pages:
>
> - Custom Lesson Generator: on the Lessons page, you can generate PPL to ATPL mini-courses, with detailed explanations. Simply prompt on the bar what do you want, and SkyAI will automatically save a detailed lesson to your library. The more you describe with details what output do you want, the more your generated lesson will be personalised and accurate. Each lesson is saved privately on your library.
> - Flashcards and Mock Exams sets: learn actively aviation terms and knowledge with these two different features, available on the Study Mode page. We suggest you to be accurate and precise when typing your request so your result will be more appropriated.
> - Aircraft Profiles: very useful AI feature integrated if you don't know the exact configurations of your aircraft\*. 
> - Radio Training sets: if you want to learn aviation radio communications, this feature is very useful to learn realistic scenarios.
> - Checklist Builder: generate in-depth checklists for flight simulation uses. Create the scenario you want and challenge yourself in realistic circumstances\*\!
>
> \*(WARNING: we do NOT recommend to use this feature for real-life flights. If you do so, we highly suggest to double-check the results with verified sources.)
