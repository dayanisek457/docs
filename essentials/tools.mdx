## What’s Inside

The Tools section is where SkyReach Academy really shines. We’ve built and curated powerful calculators, converters, and utilities, all in one place.

### Tool Categories

Tools are split by category:

- **Flight Planning** (Checklist Builder, Flight SimBoard, NavLog Generator, VATSIM Data and Flight Info Lookup)
- **Weather** (METAR/TAF Decoder, Weather Pro)
- **Navigation** (Aviation Lookup, Aircraft Reg. Lookup)
- **Calculations** (Unit Converter)

More tools can be added, by simple request via [updates.skyxintl.me](http://updates.skyxintl.me).
