## Uploading Files

You can upload your own files for free into your personal knowledge base. Files can either be shared publicly or privately stored in your account database.\
In case you publish publicly, admins will verify the content and will approve or not the publication of your file.

Be careful: you can not upload files bigger than 50MB. If you try so, the upload will automatically be denied. Each user has a storage limit of 50MB, but we are working on increasing the limit soon.
