  <Accordion title="Accessibility and personalisation settings" icon="sparkles">
    At SkyX International, our main goal is to provide aviation education for everyone. That's why we implemented accessibility features.

    On the settings page (top-right corner), you can find several accessibility features:

    - Dyslexia-friendly font, applicable on the entire workspace;
    - High contrast;
    - Font size;
    - Enable/disable animations;
    - Compact mode

      You can find the dark/light mode switch on the top bar of the interface.

    <Note>
      If your device is using custom styling features, truncated screen size or unsupported browser (currently supported browsers are: Chromium-based browsers, Safari, Firefox), the global interface and the personalisation features may not work well.
    </Note>
    To customise the interface background, several built-in themes are implemented in the settings page.

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Install our Github app" icon="message-bot">
    Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
    don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
    your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
    successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
    of the repo.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Push your changes" icon="rocket">
    [Commit and push your changes to
    Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
    for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
    the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
    update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
