    - Dyslexia-friendly font, applicable on the entire workspace;
    - High contrast;
    - Font size;
    - Enable/disable animations;
    - Compact mode

      You can find the dark/light mode switch on the top bar of the interface.

      If your device is using custom styling features, truncated screen size or unsupported browser (currently supported browsers are Chromium-based browsers, Safari and Firefox), the global interface and the personalisation features may differ from the general experience.
