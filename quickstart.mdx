    At SkyX International, our main goal is to provide aviation education for everyone. That's why we implemented accessibility features.

    On the settings page (top-right corner), you can find several accessibility features:

    - Dyslexia-friendly font, applicable on the entire workspace;
    - High contrast;
    - Font size;
    - Enable/disable animations;
    - Compact mode

      You can find the dark/light mode switch on the top bar of the interface.

    <Note>
      If your device is using custom styling features, truncated screen size or unsupported browser (currently supported browsers are Chromium-based browsers, Safari and Firefox), the global interface and the personalisation features may not work well.
    </Note>
    To customise the interface background, several built-in themes are implemented in the settings page.
